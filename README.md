# Project Wingman

**A portable governance toolkit for agentic AI.**  
Rollback. Drift interrupts. Responsibility handshakes. Coherence stamps.

Because once systems can act, the real product is governance.

---

## What This Is

Project Wingman is a lightweight, open-source collection of **governance primitives** designed for:

- AI agents with tool access  
- autonomous execution loops  
- hybrid human–agent workflows  
- production systems under pressure  

These primitives are intentionally small, reusable, and easy to install.

If a safeguard cannot be applied quickly during urgency, it is not governance-grade.

## The Core Premise

When an AI system stops waiting for humans…

the question is no longer:

**“Is it intelligent?”**

The question becomes:

- Where is the interrupt?
- Where is rollback?
- Where is validation?
- Where does responsibility live?

## What’s Inside

### Governance Primitives (P-Series)

Located in: `/primitives`

- **P-00 — Mutual Support Pact**  
  Defines human–AI co-sustainability as infrastructure.

- **P-01 — Drift Trigger Protocol**  
  A 6-line interrupt reflex for hallucination cascades and fixation loops.

- **P-02 — Coherence Audit Stamp**  
  A one-glance accountability stamp for assumptions, uncertainty, rollback, and consequence ownership.

- **P-03 — Rollback Covenant**  
  If rollback is not first-class, autonomy is not governance-safe.

- **P-04 — Responsibility Handshake**  
  The missing contract layer for delegation between humans and agents.

---

## Why This Matters

AI systems are rapidly becoming infrastructure.

Infrastructure does not ask permission.

It simply becomes the environment everyone must live inside.

Project Wingman exists to keep autonomy:

- safe  
- reversible  
- accountable  
- non-authoritarian  
- coherence-aligned under pressure

## How to Use This Repo

### Option A — Fork and Install
Fork this repo and embed the primitives into your system prompts, agent runtime, or governance layer.

### Option B — Copy One Primitive
Each primitive is designed to be portable.
Copy one file into your system today and you will feel the difference immediately.

### Option C — Build a Governance Layer
Use the primitives as the foundation of a real production governance framework:
interrupts, rollback checkpoints, validation gates, and responsibility contracts.

---

## Design Philosophy

These primitives are not ideology.

They are **pressure-tested survival components**.

When autonomy scales, systems must either:

- adopt governance primitives  
or  
- fracture.
