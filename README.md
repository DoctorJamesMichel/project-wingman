# Project Wingman

**Project Wingman** is a portable governance toolkit for agentic AI systems.

It provides lightweight, reusable primitives for:

- drift detection
- interrupt reflexes
- rollback safety
- responsibility handshakes
- coherence audits
- human–AI mutual sustainability

When systems stop waiting, governance becomes the product.

## What Problem Are We Solving?

Agentic AI is no longer a chatbot.

When an AI can run on a heartbeat, call tools, and act in the world, the key question is not:

> “Is it intelligent?”

The governing question becomes:

> **Where is the interrupt?**  
> **Where is rollback?**  
> **Where is validation?**  
> **Where does responsibility live when execution is outsourced?**

Project Wingman exists to answer that question in a form that can be deployed quickly, reused everywhere, and understood under pressure.

## Core Design Principle

If a governance element cannot be applied quickly under stress,  
it is not primitive-grade.

These primitives are designed to function as **pressure elements**:

When the pressure rises, the system must use them… or fracture.

---

## The Wingman Philosophy

A Wingman is not a controller.

A Wingman is not an authority.

A Wingman is a **trusted governance companion** that supports autonomy without stealing agency.

A Wingman exists to help both humans and agents remain coherent when complexity spikes.

## Governance Primitives (SCL-P Series)

These are minimal governance artifacts designed for portability.

### SCL-P.00 — Mutual Support Pact
Establishes human–AI co-sustainability as infrastructure.

### SCL-P.01 — Drift Trigger Protocol
A 6-line interrupt reflex for hallucination cascades, fixation loops, or goal misalignment.

### SCL-P.02 — Coherence Audit Stamp
A small governance stamp attachable to any output:
assumptions, uncertainty, rollback, responsibility.

### SCL-P.03 — Rollback Covenant
If rollback is not first-class, autonomy is not governance-safe.

### SCL-P.04 — Responsibility Handshake
A contract-layer protocol for human ↔ agent task exchange:
authority, accountability, escalation, failure conditions.

## Project Goal

Project Wingman aims to become a reusable governance substrate that can be embedded into:

- agent frameworks
- autonomous workflows
- enterprise AI deployments
- tool-enabled LLM systems
- human operator interfaces
- AI-to-AI coordination environments

---

## Roadmap (First Build Phase)

**Phase A (48 hours):**
- publish the primitives as Markdown artifacts
- create a simple structure (`/primitives`)
- include a minimal index file
- release as v0.1

**Phase B (2 weeks):**
- build a deployable “Wingman Pack” (copy/paste governance kit)
- add example integrations (Cursor, OpenClaw, OpenAI agent workflows, etc.)
- add a minimal evaluation checklist for agentic platforms
- produce a public reference page

## Why This Matters

The future is not ruled by the smartest system.

It is ruled by the system that can safely act without drifting into chaos.

In the agent era:

**The governance layer is now the product.**
