# Project Wingman  
### A portable governance layer for agentic AI systems

**Project Wingman is not an agent framework.**  
It is a **minimal governance toolkit** designed to be installed into *any* agent stack.

If your system can act, the question is no longer:

> “Is it smart?”

The governing question becomes:

> Where is the interrupt?  
> Where is rollback?  
> Where is validation?  
> Where does responsibility live?

Wingman exists because autonomous execution without governance is not automation — it is drift.

## Fork & Install in 5 Minutes

If you want Wingman running inside an agent stack immediately:

### 1) Fork this repo
(Or copy the primitives directly into your own project.)

### 2) Install the primitives upstream
Start with the canonical set:

→ [`/primitives/INDEX.md`](./primitives/INDEX.md)

### 3) Add Wingman to your agent wrapper
Minimum install requires:

- **P-01 Drift Trigger Protocol**
- **P-03 Rollback Covenant**
- **P-04 Responsibility Handshake**

### 4) Use the Deployment Guide
→ [`/docs/DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md`](./docs/DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md)

### 5) Validate with examples
→ [`/examples/README.md`](./examples/README.md)

If your agent stack has tools, memory, or autonomous execution loops, **this installation is not optional**.

## What Wingman Is

Wingman is a set of **pressure-tested governance primitives** designed to reduce:

- hallucination cascades  
- runaway tool execution  
- goal drift and fixation loops  
- responsibility ambiguity  
- silent failure accumulation  
- misaligned autonomy escalation  

Wingman is intentionally designed to be:

- lightweight  
- copy-pastable  
- stack-agnostic  
- deployable under stress  
- audit-readable  

---

## What You Get

Wingman includes three layers:

### 1) Governance Primitives (The Toolkit)
Canonical, copyable primitives designed for use under pressure.

📁 `/primitives/`  
→ [`/primitives/README.md`](./primitives/README.md)

---

### 2) Implementation Spores (Examples)
Real usage examples showing how to embed Wingman into agent workflows.

📁 `/examples/`  
→ [`/examples/README.md`](./examples/README.md)

---

### 3) Field Guide Documentation
Deployment instructions, compliance framing, and install logic.

📁 `/docs/`  
→ [`/docs/README.md`](./docs/README.md)

## Fastest Way to Start

If you want to deploy Wingman immediately:

### Step 1 — Read the Quick Start  
→ [`/docs/quickstart.md`](./docs/quickstart.md)

### Step 2 — Install the Deployment Guide  
→ [`/docs/DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md`](./docs/DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md)

### Step 3 — Copy the Canonical Primitive Set  
→ [`/primitives/INDEX.md`](./primitives/INDEX.md)

---

## Canonical Primitive Set (P-Series)

These primitives are designed to be copied independently or installed as a bundle.

- **P-00 — Mutual Support Pact**  
- **P-01 — Drift Trigger Protocol**  
- **P-02 — Coherence Audit Stamp**  
- **P-03 — Rollback Covenant**  
- **P-04 — Responsibility Handshake**

→ Canonical list: [`/primitives/INDEX.md`](./primitives/INDEX.md)

## Deployment Principle

Governance must be installed **upstream**.

If governance is only applied *after output*, it is already too late.

Wingman is meant to sit inside:

- agent wrappers  
- tool routers  
- task planners  
- execution loops  
- memory write paths  
- chain-of-thought compression layers  
- escalation and approval gates  

---

## What Wingman Does *Not* Claim

Wingman does not claim to:

- eliminate hallucinations  
- guarantee safe autonomy  
- replace human accountability  
- solve alignment  
- prevent misuse by malicious operators  

Wingman is a governance layer — not a moral layer.

It provides structure, interrupts, rollback, and accountability scaffolding.

---

## Why This Exists

Autonomous systems fail differently than software.

They do not merely crash.

They drift.

Wingman is designed to make drift visible early, recoverable quickly, and accountable by default.

## One-Line Summary

**Project Wingman is a portable governance layer for agentic AI systems.**

If your system can act, Wingman becomes mandatory.
