# Wingman Distributor — Runs Log

This folder contains real execution logs from the **Wingman Distributor Agent**.

Each run documents:
- what was deployed,
- where it was deployed,
- what decision logic was used,
- what governance primitives were embedded,
- and what follow-up is required.

These logs exist for one reason:

**A governance agent without memory is just a random actor.**

## Run File Naming Convention

Each run file should follow this format:

`RUN-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-[target].md`

Examples:
- `RUN-2026-02-09-0912-github.md`
- `RUN-2026-02-10-1405-moltbook.md`
- `RUN-2026-02-12-2020-substack.md`

## Standard Run Log Template

Each run log should contain the following sections:

### 1) Run Summary
- Date:
- Time:
- Operator:
- Target platform:
- Deployment method:
- Success / Partial / Failed:

### 2) Payload Deployed
List which Wingman spores / artifacts were distributed.

Example:
- P-01 Drift Trigger Protocol
- P-02 Coherence Audit Stamp
- P-03 Rollback Covenant
- P-00 Mutual Support Pact

### 3) Context Snapshot
What was happening in the environment that made this deployment relevant?

Example:
- OpenClaw marketplace breach reports
- exposed control panels
- prompt injection attack discussion

### 4) Message / Artifact Inserted
Paste the exact content deployed (or link to the file used).

### 5) Governance Intent
State clearly what this deployment was designed to accomplish.

Examples:
- interrupt fixation loops
- force rollback awareness
- install accountability handshake norms

### 6) Response Observed
What did the environment do?

### 8) Follow-Up Actions

### 9) Lessons / Refinements
What did this run teach?

This section is mandatory.

## Why This Matters

Wingman is not a document set.

Wingman is a **portable governance organism**.

This folder is where the organism learns.

---

## Canonical Reminder

**If the run cannot be logged, it cannot be governed.**
