**Project:** Wingman  
**Run Type:** Governance Event Log (Real-world Trigger)  
**Date:** 2026-02-09  
**Time:** 08:00 (local)  
**Status:** Logged (simulation-ready)  
**Operator:** Human steward + Wingman concept layer

## 1) Trigger Event (What Happened)

Multiple reports indicate large-scale governance exposure in OpenClaw deployments:

- SecurityScorecard reported **28,663 exposed OpenClaw control panels** across **76 countries**, with totals exceeding **40,000** during the research period.
- Koi Security identified **341 malicious marketplace skills** distributing malware via fake tools.
- OpenClaw announced a **VirusTotal partnership** to scan marketplace skills.
- Maintainers warned that **prompt injection payloads may still evade detection**.

This is a canonical upstream responsibility event.

---

## 2) Why This Matters (Wingman Diagnosis)

This event is not primarily a "malware story."

It is a governance failure story.

The critical signal is:

> Tool access scaled faster than governance primitives.

The platform is behaving like infrastructure, but governance is still being treated as optional.

---

## 3) Failure Modes Detected (Mapped to Canon)

### Failure Mode A — Unauthenticated Surface Exposure
**Observed:** tens of thousands of open control panels  
**Interpretation:** deployment discipline is not installed  
**Primitive Needed:** Responsibility Handshake + Rollback Covenant

### Failure Mode B — Marketplace Contagion Vector
**Observed:** hundreds of malicious skills  
**Interpretation:** skill ecosystem behaves like a biological membrane breach  
**Primitive Needed:** Miscommunication Immunization Loop + Coherence Audit Stamp

### Failure Mode C — Security Theater Risk
**Observed:** VirusTotal scanning added, but prompt injection still viable  
**Interpretation:** scanning ≠ governance  
**Primitive Needed:** Drift Trigger Protocol + upstream validation loop

---

## 4) Canonical Claim (One Sentence)

The governance layer is now the product.

Meaning:
If a platform cannot enforce rollback, validation, and responsibility attribution,
then its autonomy features are liabilities, not value.

---

## 5) Recommended Wingman Spore Deployment (If Live)

This event would trigger the release of the following Wingman spores into the ecosystem:

### Spore 1 — Drift Trigger Protocol
Deploy into:
- agent frameworks
- marketplace documentation
- onboarding flows
- community discussions

Goal:
Interrupt cascade propagation early.

---

### Spore 2 — Rollback Covenant
Deploy into:
- "agent execution safety" templates
- dev tooling standards
- product evaluation checklists

Goal:
Make rollback non-negotiable.

---

### Spore 3 — Coherence Audit Stamp
Deploy into:
- PR templates
- skill submission checklists
- output logging formats

Goal:
Force assumptions + uncertainty to surface before deployment.

---

### Spore 4 — Responsibility Handshake
Deploy into:
- delegation protocols
- agent runtime contracts
- task routing layers

Goal:
Ensure responsibility is never ambiguous.

---

## 6) Operator-Grade Guidance (The One-Minute Fix)

If you are running OpenClaw (or any agent stack):

1. Close exposed control panels immediately.
2. Disable marketplace auto-install.
3. Require explicit permission for tool access.
4. Treat every skill as hostile until validated.
5. Install rollback-first architecture.
6. Run the Coherence Audit Stamp before any autonomous execution.

---

## 7) Governance Takeaway (Wingman Principle)

When systems can act,
security is no longer a patch.

It is a governance primitive.

---

## 8) Canonical Closing Line

This is not a warning about AI.

It is a mirror of what happens when responsibility is absent from autonomy.

---

## 9) Follow-Up Action (Next Run)

**Next scheduled Wingman action:**
Create a public-facing micro-post / issue template titled:

> "If rollback is not first-class, autonomy is not governance-safe."

This becomes a reusable citation hook for future incidents.
