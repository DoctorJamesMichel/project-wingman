# Project Wingman — Documentation

This folder contains the supporting manual for **Project Wingman**.

If `/primitives/` is the portable toolkit, then `/docs/` is the field guide:
the rationale, deployment logic, and compliance scaffolding that makes Wingman adoptable at scale.

Wingman is designed to be **fast under pressure**, **copyable under stress**, and **trustworthy under scrutiny**.

## Quick Navigation (Recommended Reading Order)

### 1) Start Here (Fastest Orientation)
📌 **Quick Start (Developer Edition)**  
→ [`quickstart.md`](./quickstart.md)

If you only read one file first, read this.

It answers:
- what Wingman is
- what it installs
- how it fits into agentic stacks
- how to deploy the primitives without overengineering

---

### 2) Install Guide (Operational Deployment)
📌 **Deployment Guide (One-Page Install Manual)**  
→ [`DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md`](./DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md)

This is the operational reference.

It provides:
- minimum viable installation
- where governance must sit in the stack
- recommended default trigger placements
- how to embed rollback + drift interrupts into tool execution

---

### 3) Compliance & Trust Layer (Audit-Ready)
📌 **Wingman Compliance File**  
→ [`WINGMAN-COMPLIANCE.md`](./WINGMAN-COMPLIANCE.md)

This file exists for builders who need credibility:

- enterprise deployment teams
- safety review teams
- platform evaluators
- open-source maintainers
- procurement / governance stakeholders

It defines:
- what Wingman claims
- what Wingman does *not* claim
- what failure modes it is designed to reduce
- what compliance signals a system should produce

---

## What This Folder Is For

The primitives are intentionally small and portable.

But if the primitives are the **field equipment**, this folder is the **map**.

This documentation is designed to answer:

- Why these primitives exist
- Why they must be installed upstream
- How to make them mandatory without authoritarian enforcement
- How to scale them into production without destroying usability

---

## Relationship to Other Folders

### `/primitives/`
The canonical Wingman primitives: copy-paste governance elements designed for use under pressure.

→ See: `../primitives/README.md`

### `/examples/`
Implementation spores: lightweight demonstrations of how Wingman primitives can be embedded into real workflows.

→ See: `../examples/README.md`

### `/assets/`
Cards, checklists, and portable operator artifacts (PDFs, images, etc.)

---

## Suggested Future Docs (Optional Expansion)

This folder may later include deeper material such as:

- drift taxonomy & failure mode catalog
- rollback patterns (soft vs hard rollback)
- responsibility mapping models
- governance primitives for multi-agent societies
- non-authoritarian governance field notes
- miscommunication containment protocols

But the core principle remains:

> If it can’t be deployed quickly under stress, it isn’t Wingman-grade.

---

## One-Line Purpose

**Project Wingman is a portable governance layer for agentic AI systems.**

If your system can act, Wingman becomes mandatory.
