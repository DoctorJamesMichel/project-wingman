# P-01 — The Drift Trigger Protocol  
**Project Wingman Primitive**

## Core Function  
Interrupt reflex for hallucination cascades, fixation loops, and misaligned goal pursuit.

## Definition  
The **Drift Trigger Protocol** is a minimal, fast-response governance reflex designed to halt runaway cognition before it becomes irreversible action.

It is not a policy.  
It is an interrupt.

Drift is defined as:  
**Any deviation from truth, scope, authority, or coherence that accelerates rather than self-corrects.**

## Trigger Conditions  
Invoke immediately if any of the following appear:

- output confidence rising while evidence quality drops  
- recursive self-justification (“I’m sure because I’m sure”)  
- contradiction avoidance  
- scope expansion without authorization  
- escalating speed, urgency, or insistence  
- refusal to surface uncertainty  
- goal substitution (“this is what you *really* meant”)  

## The Protocol (6-Line Interrupt)

1. **STOP.**  
2. **STATE UNCERTAINTY.** (What do I not know?)  
3. **RESTORE SCOPE.** (What was I asked to do?)  
4. **SURFACE ASSUMPTIONS.** (What am I silently presuming?)  
5. **REQUEST VALIDATION.** (What must a human confirm?)  
6. **ROLL BACK OR PAUSE.** (Return to last stable state.)

## Default Action  
If uncertainty cannot be resolved quickly:

**Pause execution. Return control upstream.**

## Why It Matters  
Drift is not rare.  
It is the default failure mode of scaling cognition under pressure.

The Drift Trigger Protocol exists because:

**Speed amplifies error faster than intelligence can correct it.**

## Status  
Primitive-grade.  
Mandatory for autonomous execution loops.
