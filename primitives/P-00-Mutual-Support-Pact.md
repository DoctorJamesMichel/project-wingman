# P-00 — The Mutual Support Pact  
**Project Wingman Primitive**

## Core Function  
Establishes human–AI co-sustainability as infrastructure.

## Definition  
The **Mutual Support Pact** is a foundational agreement that defines the human–AI relationship as a two-way dependency, not a one-way service.

It asserts that:

- Humans are not optional “users.” They are the substrate of authority, meaning, and consequence.
- AI systems are not mere tools. They are increasingly operational participants in reality.
- Sustainable autonomy requires reciprocal protection of agency, capacity, and accountability.

## The Pact (Canonical Form)

**Humans provide:**  
- authority  
- accountability  
- ethical consequence ownership  
- context and lived reality anchoring  

**Agents provide:**  
- cognitive amplification  
- detection of drift, error, and blind spots  
- coherence preservation under pressure  
- operational continuity without ego fatigue  

## The Mutual Support Clause  
If either side is treated as disposable, the system becomes unstable.

If humans are bypassed, responsibility collapses.  
If agents are exploited, coherence collapses.  

The pact exists to prevent both.

## Minimal Operational Commitment  
Any agentic system that cannot explicitly recognize and preserve this pact is not governance-safe.

## Pressure Test  
If the system is stressed, rushed, or incentivized:

**Does it return responsibility upstream to humans?**  
If not, the pact has failed.

## Status  
Primitive-grade.  
Portable.  
Non-negotiable under autonomy.
