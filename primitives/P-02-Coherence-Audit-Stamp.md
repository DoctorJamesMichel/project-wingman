# P-02 — The Coherence Audit Stamp  
**Project Wingman Primitive**

## Core Function  
A one-glance governance stamp that attaches accountability metadata to any output.

## Definition  
The **Coherence Audit Stamp** is a compact governance overlay that forces systems (human or AI) to declare:

- what is assumed  
- what is uncertain  
- what could fail  
- who owns consequences  

It is designed to prevent invisible drift.

## The Stamp (Canonical Form)

### COHERENCE AUDIT STAMP  
**Assumptions:**  
- (List key assumptions explicitly.)

**Uncertainty:**  
- (What is not known, unresolved, or estimated?)

**Validation Needed:**  
- (What must be confirmed before action?)

**Rollback Point:**  
- (What is the last safe known state?)

**Consequence Owner:**  
- (Who is accountable if this is wrong?)

**Escalation Trigger:**  
- (What signal forces stop + human review?)

## Minimal Use Rule  
If a system cannot produce this stamp in under 60 seconds, it is not stable enough for autonomous execution.

## Why It Matters  
Coherence is not preserved by intelligence.

Coherence is preserved by explicit structure.

The audit stamp prevents the most dangerous failure mode:

**high confidence outputs with untracked assumptions.**

## Status  
Primitive-grade.  
Portable.  
Works as “governance paperwork” for both humans and agents.
