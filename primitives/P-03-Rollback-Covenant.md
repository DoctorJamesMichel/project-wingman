# P-03 — The Rollback Covenant  
**Project Wingman Primitive**

## Core Function  
Defines rollback as a first-class governance requirement for autonomy.

## Definition  
The **Rollback Covenant** is a compact rule of safe autonomy:

**If rollback is not first-class, autonomy is not governance-safe.**

This covenant asserts that the ability to reverse action is not optional safety polish.

It is the defining boundary between:

- experimentation vs catastrophe  
- autonomy vs runaway execution  
- governance vs irreversibility  

## The Covenant (Canonical Form)

Any agentic system that can act in the world must provide:

- a recoverable state history  
- explicit rollback triggers  
- a defined last-known-stable point  
- a human override path  
- auditability of actions taken  
- a graceful fail-safe mode  

## Rollback Trigger Examples  
Rollback must be invoked when:

- the system detects contradiction or drift  
- the environment changes outside modeled bounds  
- execution produces unexpected outcomes  
- the system exceeds authorized scope  
- uncertainty rises above threshold  
- a human issues a STOP command  
- monitoring flags safety violation risk  

## Rollback Priority Rule  
Rollback is always preferred over explanation.

When consequences are real, coherence beats narrative.

## Why It Matters  
Most autonomy failures are not caused by malicious intent.

They are caused by:

**irreversible momentum.**

Rollback breaks momentum.

Rollback restores governance.

## Status  
Primitive-grade.  
Non-negotiable under real-world tool access.
