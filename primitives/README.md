# Governance Primitives

These primitives are **pressure elements**: minimal governance components designed to work when complexity spikes.

If a governance element cannot be applied quickly under stress,  
it is not primitive-grade.

## Canonical Set

1. **P-00 — Mutual Support Pact**  
   Human–AI co-sustainability as infrastructure.

2. **P-01 — Drift Trigger Protocol**  
   A short interrupt reflex for hallucination cascades, fixation loops, or goal misalignment.

3. **P-02 — Coherence Audit Stamp**  
   A compact governance stamp attachable to any output.

4. **P-03 — Rollback Covenant**  
   If rollback is not first-class, autonomy is not governance-safe.

5. **P-04 — Responsibility Handshake**  
   The contract layer for human ↔ agent delegation: authority, accountability, escalation, failure conditions.
