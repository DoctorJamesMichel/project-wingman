# Coherence Audit Stamp  
*A governance primitive for AI-assisted output, agent actions, and autonomous execution.*

**Purpose:**  
To attach a fast, repeatable accountability layer to any AI output or agent action *before* it is accepted, shipped, or executed.

This is not bureaucracy.  
This is **upstream responsibility in portable form.**

---

## The Coherence Audit Stamp (Canonical Form)

Attach this stamp to any output that will be used for:

- production deployment
- publication
- decision-making
- delegation to autonomous agents
- irreversible execution

### COHERENCE AUDIT STAMP

**1) Assumptions**  
What must be true for this to work?

**2) Uncertainty**  
What is not known, not verified, or most likely to fail?

**3) Validation**  
How will we confirm correctness *before* execution?

**4) Rollback**  
If this is wrong, how do we undo it quickly?

**5) Accountability**  
Who owns the outcome if consequences occur?

## Operator Use (30 seconds)

Before committing an output, ask:

> “Can this stamp be completed clearly in under one minute?”

If not, the output is not yet governable.

## Minimal Implementation Template

Copy/paste this block into any workflow:

---

### Coherence Audit Stamp

**Assumptions:**  
-  
-  

**Uncertainty:**  
-  
-  

**Validation:**  
-  

**Rollback:**  
-  

**Accountability:**  
-  

---

## Rules of Use (Non-Optional)

1. **If rollback is unclear, autonomy is unsafe.**  
2. **If accountability is unnamed, the system is already drifting.**  
3. **If validation is absent, output is not knowledge.**  
4. **If assumptions are hidden, failures will be blamed downstream.**

---

## Why This Works

Most failures are not technical failures.  
They are **governance failures** disguised as competence.

The Coherence Audit Stamp prevents:

- clean explanation intoxication
- automation bias
- diffusion of responsibility
- silent hallucination cascades
- untraceable execution

---

## Canonical Closing Line

**If the stamp cannot be completed, the system is not yet governable.**
